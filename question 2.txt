Suggestion:
1. Add indexing to the table which find records with the specific coloumn values quickly instead of searching from first record to last record.
2. Add fulltext to the table columns which required to use 'LIKE' search
	eg: ALTER TABLE JobTypes ADD FULLTEXT(name);
	then in your where clause: MATCH(JobTypes.name) AGAINST("キャビンアテンダント");
